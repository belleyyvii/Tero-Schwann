1. My project title is "My performance task python project, a simple calculator."

  2. The purpose of my project is to build a functional tool for users while also practicing or improving my understanding of programming concepts and improve my problem-solving skills. My project is about creating a calculator using Python, where it'll likely focus on implementing basic arithmetic operations.

  3. My Python calculator works by allowing the user to select an operator and input the numbers she wants, then it performs the calculation and displays the result. To run it, you just need to click the playbutton that runs the python file, then input numbers on the output terminal.
